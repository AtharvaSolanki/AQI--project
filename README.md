# AQI--project
I have created a project using python and machine learning for providing the AQI
The purpose of the project is to build a module that can predict the Air Quality Index of the upcoming days by analyzing the past data. We will train the data using machine learning algorithm called multi-linear regression and then predict the result and match it with the actual AQI.
Here we are using python language and we are using the dataset that I collected from the official website of Central Pollution Control Board(CPCB).The main purpose of the project isto analyze the factors which are responsible for increasing the AQI and based on those factors we predicted the upcoming days AQI.
